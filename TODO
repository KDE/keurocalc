Closing bug on Enlightment
(http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=355386)


FUNCTIONALITY
=============

Allow more data sources:
- US Federal reserve
  http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/H10/Update/h10daily.txt
- PACIFIC Exchange Rate Service
  http://fx.sauder.ubc.ca/today.html
- Bank of Canada
  http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/financial_markets/csv/exchange_eng.csv

Allow querying the exchange rates of some date in the past.

Add buttons to selectively clear input, display or memory.

Do not show all currencies in the default currency setting,
only the ones that the selected data source offers.

Have a "tape" window where intermediate results get "printed",
like a roll of paper.

Add a button to show rates in a separate window.

Add a button to refresh rates.

Allow to store rates for offline use (laptops) or archiving.


SYSTEM INTEGRATION
==================

Allow cut and paste of data.

Let keurocalc act as a desktop panel applet.


COSMETICAL
==========

Non-blocking wait during the splash screen.

Better geometry management.

Add country flags.
