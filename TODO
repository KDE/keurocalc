FUNCTIONALITY
=============

Allow more data sources:
- US Federal reserve
  http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/H10/Update/h10daily.txt
- PACIFIC Exchange Rate Service
  http://fx.sauder.ubc.ca/today.html
- Bank of Canada
  http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/financial_markets/csv/exchange_eng.csv

Allow using the exchange rates of some date in the past.

Add buttons to selectively clear input, display or memory.

Add settings:
- rounding legal/nextcoin/no
- display color

Do not show all currencies in the default currency setting,
only the ones that the selected data source offers.

Have a "tape" window where intermediate results get "printed",
like a roll of paper.


SYSTEM INTEGRATION
==================

Allow cut and paste of data.

Make keurocalc become a kparts component that can be included in
kspread for example.

Let keurocalc offer a desktop panel applet.


COSMETICAL
==========

Non-blocking wait during the splash screen.

Display the currencies sorted by their code in the drop-down lists.

Better geometry management.

Add country flags.
